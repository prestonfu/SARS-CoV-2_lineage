# SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Evaluation

Like most RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is actively mutating, and there are already thousands of different SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide. The minute variations between these lineages are not yet large enough to warrant distinction as a strain, and it is currently unclear how nucleotide differences correspond to virus function. However, as the virus continues to spread, it is more likely to mutate into faster-spreading or more lethal strains.

This project aims to inform of these differences predicting the origin regions of SARS-CoV-2 lineages based on their genomes. Ultimately, we achieve an accuracy of 95.2% using L1 normalization on logistic regression. Our model enables large-scale contact tracing: by identifying the lineages afflicting COVID-19 patients, one may reverse-engineer the paths by which particular lineages were transmitted. This in turn allows for suppression: countries and regions at which thousands of lineages originated should receive technological aid and should shut down immigration, emigration, and interstate travel.

This project was conducted under the mentorship of James Thomson at Inspirit AI, June 2020.
